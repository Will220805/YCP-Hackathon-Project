SiGNALS - An abusive relationship detection game

- "Signals" is an interactive, narrative-driven game that explores the complexities of relationships through subtle cues, hidden meanings, and everyday interactions. 
- Players step into the shoes of a character navigating a romantic relationship that blends affection with hints of control, respect with moments of manipulation, and trust with underlying tension. 
- With each choice, players uncover layers of their partner's personality and intentions, while shaping their own self-awareness and boundaries.
